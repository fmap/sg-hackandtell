So Hack&Tell is a format which seems to adapt a bit to the regional flavor but
there are some core values that should not be changed. Here's how I run it:

1. Present a hack and the tech behind it, not pitch your startup. (If your new
startup does something cool please DEMO the sweet stuff and talk about the tech
behind it.)

2. DEMO & explain, don't do a PowerPoint show. (I usually limit the slides to
1).

3. Make the event hacker friendly. Feel free to cut off any suits trying to
hijack your event with business or hiring talk.

4. To make the event more useful I created the flea market session 10min before
the pizza break. People can come to the mic and talk 2 sentences about a new
job, request project help or announce an event. This is a good basis for the
conversations in the break.

5. If you decide to let the event be sponsored (pizza, drinks etc) make sure
the sponsor knows what to expect. I tell them in the face that they get their
logo on the announcement and 3min intro at the beginning and that's it. I
always try to get a different sponsor each time to keep the brand Hack and Tell
independent.

6. Announce the event early and encourage friends to swing by and present it.

7. Recently we introduced the concept of "Hack of the months" which is voted by
the audience at the end of the event. It encourages hackers to compete more and
let more people stay until the end.
